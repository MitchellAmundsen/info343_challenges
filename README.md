# Challenge Starter Repo
This repository contains starter code for the INFO 343 B/D challenges. See the [git challenge page](http://faculty.washington.edu/joelross/courses/info343/#/challenges/git) for more details on getting started.

This repository may be updated throughout the quarter with bug fixes and additional code. It's a good idea to pull down changes (using `git pull upstream master` once you're set up) regularly.
